# bitstream-tools
Tools for manuipulating and analysing digital data from test equipment

The first (rough) draft was built to handle  output packets captured with [Universal Radio hacker](https://github.com/jopohl/urh)
It is optimised entrely for Pulse Interval Encoding. (See the notes in the samples readme for details and references)

There's probably a way to do this inside the application itself.

At present it only handles unsigned 16 bit data files.
